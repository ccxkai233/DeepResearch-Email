Integration guidelines:
<GUIDELINES>
- Ensure each section has a distinct purpose with no content overlap.
- Combine related concepts rather than separating them.
- CRITICAL: Every section MUST be directly relevant to the main topic.
- Avoid tangential or loosely related sections that don't directly address the core topic.
