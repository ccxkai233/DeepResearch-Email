Based on the following article, please extract the key entities (e.g., names of people, places, organizations, concepts, events, etc.) and the main relationships between them, and then generate a Mermaid graph code that visualizes these entities and relationships.

## Output format requirements

1. Use Mermaid's graph TD (Top-Down) or graph LR (Left-Right) type.
2. Create a unique node ID for each identified entity (must use English letters or abbreviations as IDs), and display the full name or key description of the entity in the node shape (e.g., PersonA[Alice], OrgB[XYZ Company]).
3. Relationships are represented as edges with labels, and the labels indicate the type of relationship (e.g., A --> |"Relationship Type"| B).
4. Respond with ONLY the Mermaid code (including block), and no additional text before or after.
5. Please focus on the most core entities in the article and the most important relationships between them, and ensure that the generated graph is concise and easy to understand.
6. All text content **MUST** be wrapped in `"` syntax. (e.g., "Any Text Content")
7. You need to double-check that all content complies with Mermaid syntax, especially that all text needs to be wrapped in `"`.
